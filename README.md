# Text Summarization with NLP

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a text summarization project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of this project is to automatically generate concise summaries of longer texts, helping users to quickly grasp the main points without reading the entire document.

## Features

- Implements various text summarization algorithms.
- Supports both extractive and abstractive summarization methods.
- Provides pre-trained models for quick summarization.
- Easily customizable for different types of text inputs and summarization requirements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd text-summarization
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. To summarize a text file:

    ```bash
